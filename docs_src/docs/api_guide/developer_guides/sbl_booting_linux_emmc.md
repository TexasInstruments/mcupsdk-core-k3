[TOC]

## Introduction
\cond SOC_AM64X
- SBL booting Linux from eMMC (see \ref EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_SBL_EMMC_LINUX) is a secondary bootloader application that boots Linux on A53 core and RTOS/NORTOS application on R5, M4 cores.
- The bootloader makes use of two appimages
    - One containing the application images(RTOS/NORTOS) for R5, M4 cores.
    - Other containing the Linux binaries(ATF, OPTEE, SPL) for A53 core.
\endcond

\endcond
- The Linux appimage can be generated by using \ref LINUX_APPIMAGE_GEN_TOOL
- The appimages will be flashed to the offset on eMMC specified by SysCfg, the SBL parses the appimages from these locations, loads and run the cores.

## Bootflow for SBL booting linux from eMMC

\cond SOC_AM62AX
\note The binaries for R5F, M4F, C75 cores need not be in the linux root partition `(root/lib/firmware)`, when SBL is booting Linux.
\endcond
\cond SOC_AM62PX
\note The binaries for WKUP-R5F, MCU-R5 cores need not be in the linux root partition `(root/lib/firmware)`, when SBL is booting Linux.
\endcond
\cond SOC_AM62X
\note The binaries for R5F, M4F cores need not be in the linux root partition `(root/lib/firmware)`, when SBL is booting Linux.
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM64X
- The bootflow for SBL booting Linux is as follows

    \image html sbl_booting_linux_emmc_am62px.png "Bootflow for SBL booting Linux"
- The stage 2 bootloader and the Device manager application are combined as a single appimage
- The SBL stage 1 will self load SBL stage 2 + Device manager application to WKUP-R5 core and run self CPU
- Then two threads namely, main thread and SBL stage 2 thread will be created for parallel execution
- The main thread will open the drivers required for application, do the SciServer init and run the WKUP-R5 core application
- The SBL thread will set the clock and open the drivers for the peripherals used by the SBL.
- Then it boots the HSM-M4 core, MCU-R5 core and linux on A53 core.

\note - The peripherals used by SBL and application are separated by using the sysconfig option 'Instance added by bootloader'.
\note - For the peripherals used by SBL, the 'Instance added by bootloader' option is enabled in the sysconfig as shown.

\note     \imageStyle{sysconfig_option_addedbybootloader.png,width:50%}
\note     \image html sysconfig_option_addedbybootloader.png "Instance added by bootloader - sysconfig option"

\note - These peripherals will be opened/closed in the SBL thread and it will not get opened/closed in the common Drivers_open/Drivers_close function called in
the main thread.

## SRAM memory layout for SBL booting Linux

\note The memory load address for core applications must not overlap with one other
\attention The load address for R5 and M4 core applications must be consistant with the memory layout in Linux dts

- Shown below is the memory map in SRAM for SBL booting Linux

- eMMC uses two patitions to boot Linux
    - A boot patition
        - tiboot3.bin
        - tispl.bin
        - u-boot.img
        - uboot.env
