# By default this config file,
# - points to pre-built flash writer, bootloader for this EVM
# - The application image points to relative path of the ipc rpmsg linux application image for this EVM
#   - Make sure this application is built before running this script
# - You can customized this config file to point to your own bootloader and/or application images
# - You can use --operation=flashverify if you just want to verify the flash contents and not flash the file.

# First point to sbl_uart_uniflash_stage1 binary, which initialises DDR and receives sbl_uart_uniflash_stage2 binary

# When sending sbl_uart_uniflash_stage2 binary make sure to flash at SOC memory offset 0x0.
# Points to sbl_uart_uniflash_stage2 binary, which function's as a server to flash one or more files

# Now send one or more files to flash or flashverify as needed. The order of sending files does not matter

# When sending bootloader make sure to flash at offset 0x0. ROM expects bootloader at offset 0x0
