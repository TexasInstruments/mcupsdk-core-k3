 *
 *  ## Introduction to SCICLIENT
 *  The SCIClient is an interface to the TI-SCI protocol for RTOS and non-OS
 *  based applications. It exposes the core message details, valid module/clock
 *  IDs to the higher level software and abstracts the communication with the
 *  firmware based on the TI-SCI protocol. These APIs can be called by power,
 *  resource and security RTOS drivers or any other non-OS or RTOS based higher
 *  level software to be able to communicate with DMSC for its services. The
 *  higher level software is expected to populate the necessary message core
 *  parameters. The SCIClient would wrap the core message with the necessary
 *  protocol header and forward this to the DMSC. The SCIClient relies on the
 *  CSL-FL layer to program and interact with the Secure Proxy Threads. The
 *  SCIClient's goal is to ensure there is no duplication of the interface to
 *  the DMSC from different software components which need to interact with
 *  the DMSC or other System Control Entities in future devices.
 *  The Sciclient contains
 *  - \ref SCICLIENT_HAL
 *  - \ref SCICLIENT_FMW_PM_IF
 *  - \ref SCICLIENT_FMW_RM_IF
 *  - \ref SCICLIENT_FMW_PROCBOOT_IF
 *  - \ref SCICLIENT_ROM_HAL
 *
 * ## Introduction to DMSC
 * Traditional Texas Instruments SoCs have implemented system control
 * functions such as power management within operating systems on each of
 * the processing units (ARM/DSP). However, such a traditional approach
 * has had tremendous challenges to ensure system stability. Few of the
 * challenges faced include:
 *
 * - Complex interactions between Operating Systems on heterogeneous SoCs for
 *   generic features.
 * - Lack of centralized knowledge of system state.
 * - Consistency in SoC feature entitlement in all OSes for the SoC for
 *   complex SoC features and system quirks.
 *
 * Device Management and Security control (DMSC) attempts to resolve
 * these issues by being a consistent component of Keystone 3 SoC
 * architecture performing the role of a centralized SoC power, security
 * and device management controller.
 *
 * In effect, this is a microcontroller and runs a safety and security
 * certified firmware that provides services to the rest of the
 * OSes/Software running on various other processors on the SoC.
 *
 * ### DMSC Power Management
 * DMSC controls the power management of the device, hence is responsible for
 * bringing the device out of reset, enforce clock and reset rules. DMSC power
 * management functions are critical to bring device to low power modes, for
 * example DeepSleep, and sense wake-up events to bring device back online to
 * active state.
 *
 * ### DMSC Security Management
 * The DMSC firmware Security Management manages SoC central security
 * resources. The security subsystem provides APIs to other software entities to
 * avail these features in a controlled and secure way.
 * The security management firmware is subdivided into modules listed below:
 * - Firewall management
 * - ISC management
 * - Boot authentication
 * - SA2UL context management (for encryption and authentication)
 * - Crypto APIs (to access common SA2UL functions such as PKA, RNG)
 * - Secure keys management
 * - Secure debug
 *
 * ### DMSC Resource Management
 * The DMSC firmware Resource Management (RM) (sub) system manages SoC shared
 * resources.  RM manages access and configuration of shared resources amongst
 * SoC processing entities.  RM provides a set of interfaces over which SoC
 * processing entities can allocate and free access to shared resources.
 *
 * The resource management firmware is subdivided into modules listed below:
 * - Core database
 * - IRQ management
 * - Ring accelerator management
 * - UDMA-P management
 * - PSI-L management
 * - Non-secure proxy management
 *
 * ### Communication with DMSC
 * DMSC is a "black box" with respect to the other processing
 * entities (ARM/DSP) on the SoC. Communication with DMSC occurs over
 * a messaging protocol called the Texas Instruments System Control
 * Interface (TI-SCI). TI-SCI is a predefined request-response protocol
 * that provides access to the various services provided by DMSC.
 *
 * The actual messaging hardware block varies depending on SoC, but
 * typical examples include "Proxy over message manager" and
 * "Secure Proxy over Ring Accellerator". These communication
 * mechanisms are standardized and secured by DMSC firmware prior to
 * operation.
 *
 * The request/response format is described overall as in Figure 2 . The
 * message type describes the service to be performed and is operated
 * on depending on few attributes including privileges allowed and
 * operational state of the SoC.
 *
 * |Type | Byte Index| Data Type| Header
 * |:----|:---------:|:--------:|:------
 * |TISCI Header| [0:1]| U16| Message_type
 * || [2]| uint8_t| Host
 * || [3]| uint8_t| Sequence_id
 * || [4:7]| U32| Flags
 * |Payload | Depends on type of message||Payload Fields|

 *
 *  The SCIClient has two major functions:
 *  - Interact with DMSC ROM and load the DMSC Firmware.
 *  - Pass on service requests from higher level software to the DMSC firmware
 *    and forward the response from DMSC firmware to the higher level software.
 *
 * The #Sciclient_loadFirmware API is used to cater to the first requirement
 * and the #Sciclient_service is used to cater to the second. The SCIClient
 * library requires initialization of the a handle which is used by the
 * subsequent API calls. This handle is initialized by the #Sciclient_init
 * function. Once the application/higher level software is being torn down or
 * exiting the #Sciclient_deinit can be used to de-initialize this handle.
 *
 * The SCIClient can operate in the following combinations:
 *
 * 1. Non-OS, Polling based message completion.
 * 2. Non-OS, Interrupt Based message completion.
 * 3. RTOS, Polling based message completion.
 * 4. RTOS, Interrupt based message completion.
 *
 * The SCIClient depends on the OSAL layer to differentiate between the
 * Non-OS and the RTOS implementation of Semaphores and Interrupts (HWIs).
 * The build parameter of the OSAL library would determine if the application
 * is bare metal or RTOS based. The polling versus interrupt based wait for
 * message completion is a run time configuration passed during the
 * #Sciclient_init initialization.
 *
 * All the APIs for interacting with the firmware are blocking with a
 * specified timeout . A common API #Sciclient_service is implemented for
 * all types of calls to the firmware which takes 2 arguments :
 * - #Sciclient_ReqPrm_t
 * - #Sciclient_RespPrm_t
 *
 * The API serves a particular request, based on the value of messageType
 * parameter in #Sciclient_ReqPrm_t, whose response is given to the higher
 * level API through #Sciclient_RespPrm_t. The #Sciclient_ReqPrm_t contains
 * the required inputs from the higher level software corresponding to the
 * message_type, timeout value and the core message as a byte stream.
 * A pointer #Sciclient_RespPrm_t has to be passed to the sciclient, which
 * shall be modified by sciclient.
 *
 * The Sciclient shall be responsible for abstracting all interaction with the
 * secure proxy and the ring accelerator.

 * Public APIs are provided to directly configure these features following polices and root of trust:
 *
 * - ISC
 * - Present at originator/master interfaces to control credentials from master
 * - Firewall
 * - Additional layer of access control beyond MMU/MPU located at each destination/slave interface to control memory and register access
