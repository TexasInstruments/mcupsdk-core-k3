# By default this config file,
# - points to sbl uart bootloader for this EVM
# - points to sciserver appimage for the DMR5

#   - Make sure this application is built before running this script
# - You can customized this config file to point to your application images

# First point to sbl_uart binary, which function's as a server to receive application images of other cores through uart
