# By default this config file,
# - points to pre-built flash writer, bootloader for this EVM
# - The application image points to relative path of the ipc rpmsg linux application image for this EVM
#   - Make sure this application is built before running this script
# - You can customized this config file to point to your own bootloader and/or application images
# - You can use --operation=flashverify if you just want to verify the flash contents and not flash the file.
